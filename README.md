# Jarvis: Agentic Security Framework 🕵️‍♂️

Jarvis is an autonomous security research assistant powered by Llama 3.3 (via Groq). It chains Kali Linux tools together based on real-time terminal output analysis to perform evidence-based security audits.

### 🚀 Features
- **Autonomous Chaining**: Jarvis decides the next tool based on the results of the previous one.
- **Loop Prevention**: Maintains a tool history to avoid redundant scans.
- **Hallucination-Free Reporting**: Final reports are strictly grounded in terminal output.
- **Auto-Saving**: Reports are saved as Markdown files in the `reports/` folder.

   `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/jarvis.git && cd jarvis`
2. **Install requirements:**
   `pip install requests`
3. **Set your Groq API Key:**
